      <h1>Governor-General of Pakistan</h1>
      <p><b>Muhammad Ali Jinnah</b> (25 December 1876 – 11 September 1948) was a barrister, politician, and the founder of
          Pakistan. Jinnah served as the leader of the All-India Muslim League from 1913 until the inception of Pakistan
          on 14 August 1947, and then as the Dominion of Pakistan's first governor-general until his death.
  
          Born at Wazir Mansion in Karachi, Jinnah was trained as a barrister at Lincoln's Inn in London, England. Upon
          his return to India, he enrolled at the Bombay High Court, and took an interest in national politics, which
          eventually replaced his legal practice. Jinnah rose to prominence in the Indian National Congress in the first
          two decades of the 20th century. In these early years of his political career, Jinnah advocated Hindu–Muslim
          unity, helping to shape the 1916 Lucknow Pact between the Congress and the All-India Muslim League, in which
          Jinnah had also become prominent. Jinnah became a key leader in the All-India Home Rule League, and proposed a
          fourteen-point constitutional reform plan to safeguard the political rights of Muslims in the Indian
          subcontinent. In 1920, however, Jinnah resigned from the Congress when it agreed to follow a campaign of
          satyagraha, which he regarded as political anarchy.
  
          By 1940, Jinnah had come to believe that the Muslims of the subcontinent should have their own state to avoid
          the possible marginalised status they may gain in an independent Hindu–Muslim state. In that year, the Muslim
          League, led by Jinnah, passed the Lahore Resolution, demanding a separate nation for Indian Muslims. During the
          Second World War, the League gained strength while leaders of the Congress were imprisoned, and in the
          provincial elections held shortly after the war, it won most of the seats reserved for Muslims. Ultimately, the
          Congress and the Muslim League could not reach a power-sharing formula that would allow the entirety of British
          India to be united as a single state following independence, leading all parties to agree instead to the
          independence of a predominantly Hindu India, and for a Muslim-majority state of Pakistan.</p>
